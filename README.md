Median
======

---
This program starts with an array of values sequential numeric values with 5 elements. This shows different
ways to get the median of the array. One is to sort the array first using a simple O(n^2) bubble sort, my own implementation
after reading it on Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort

(NOT IMPLEMENTED) The next method is to not sort the array pick an arbitrary element, random, and determine if that is the median.

Sort an array using the easiest to implement sorting function. This is bubblesort a naive approach where you compare
the element of an array with the element next to it if the value is bigger swap it. It iterates through the loop until
nothing is looped back.
